\arguments{
\item{y_vec}{Integer vector. Binary response variable (must contain only 0s and 1s).}

\item{X_mat}{Numeric matrix. Covariate matrix for the prognostic part and for
forming interactions with the treatment indicator \code{Z_vec}.
Each row is an observation, each column is a covariate.}

\item{Z_vec}{Numeric vector. Treatment indicator (e.g., 0 or 1) or other key
variable modifying the effect of covariates in \code{X_mat}. Must have the same
length as \code{y_vec} and the number of rows in \code{X_mat}.}

\item{n_iter}{Integer. Total number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{burn_in}{Integer. Number of initial MCMC iterations to discard as burn-in.
Must be less than \code{n_iter}.}

\item{alpha_prior_sd}{Numeric scalar. Standard deviation for the normal prior
of the global intercept \code{alpha}. Default is 10.0.}

\item{aleph_prior_sd}{Numeric scalar. Standard deviation for the normal prior
of the intercept \code{aleph} for the treatment-specific modifier part. Default is 10.0.}

\item{init_alpha}{Numeric scalar. Initial value for the global intercept \code{alpha}.
Default is 0.0.}

\item{init_aleph}{Numeric scalar. Initial value for the intercept \code{aleph} of the
treatment-specific modifier. Default is 0.0.}

\item{seed}{Integer or NULL. Seed for R's random number generator to ensure
reproducibility. Default is 1848.}
}
\value{
A list containing MCMC samples (after burn-in) for the model parameters:
\describe{
\item{alpha}{Numeric vector of samples for the global intercept \code{alpha}.}
\item{beta}{Numeric matrix of samples for the main prognostic effects.}
\item{beta_interaction}{Numeric matrix of samples for prognostic interaction effects.}
\item{aleph}{Numeric vector of samples for the treatment-specific intercept.}
\item{gamma}{Numeric matrix of samples for the treatment modifier coefficients.}
\item{gamma_int}{Numeric matrix of samples for treatment interaction terms.}
\item{tau_j}{Numeric matrix of samples for local shrinkage parameters.}
\item{tau_int_fixed_value}{Numeric scalar, fixed value of 1.0.}
\item{lambda_gamma}{Numeric matrix of samples for local Horseshoe parameters.}
\item{lambda_g_int}{Numeric matrix of samples for interaction Horseshoe parameters.}
\item{tau_hs_combined}{Numeric vector of samples for the global Horseshoe parameter.}

\description{
Performs MCMC sampling for a Bayesian logistic regression model. This is a
pure R implementation. The model includes a prognostic part with linked
shrinkage priors for main effects (\code{beta}) and their interactions
(\code{beta_interaction}). It also includes a treatment-specific modifier part,
where the treatment indicator \code{Z_vec} multiplies an intercept term (\code{aleph}),
main covariate effects (\code{gamma_vec}), and two-way covariate interaction
effects (\code{gamma_int_vec}). The \code{gamma_vec} and \code{gamma_int_vec} coefficients
are given Horseshoe priors with a shared global shrinkage parameter
(\code{tau_hs_combined}). The \code{tau_int_param} for \code{beta_interaction} terms
is fixed at 1.0 in this version.

This function relies on the \code{BayesLogit} package for Polya-Gamma sampling
and the \code{MASS} package for multivariate normal sampling. Ensure these are
installed and listed in your package's DESCRIPTION file if applicable.
